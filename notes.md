# Volarb Autonomous Butterfly Bot — Working Notes

This file is a living notebook for Aryan's design ideas. It should capture intent, interpretations, open questions, constraints, and architecture decisions as the discussion evolves. Do not treat early notes as final specifications unless explicitly marked as decided.

## Core objective

Transform the existing Volarb research and market-outlook ecosystem into an autonomous trading system focused primarily on managing short-gamma butterfly positions.

## Working principles

- Capture ideas first; formalize architecture later.
- Distinguish raw ideas from interpreted requirements and final decisions.
- Preserve uncertainty and open questions instead of silently inventing assumptions.
- Keep research, market-state assessment, trade construction, execution, monitoring, risk management, and post-trade learning conceptually separable unless a later design decision intentionally combines them.
- Do not assume that an existing research result automatically authorizes live trading behavior.

## Notes log

### 2026-10-03 — Initial direction

**Raw intent:** Build an autonomous trading bot around Volarb, especially for short-gamma butterfly positions.

**Interpretation:** The eventual system should move beyond the current research-only `agent/` laboratory and be capable of operational decision-making around butterfly trades. The precise autonomy boundary, execution authority, risk controls, strategy-selection logic, monitoring cadence, and relationship to the existing research agent remain to be defined through subsequent discussion.

## Open questions / unresolved design choices

- What decisions should be fully autonomous versus require human approval?
- What exact instruments, expiries, entry windows, and butterfly constructions are in scope?
- What market-regime conditions should permit or forbid short-gamma deployment?
- How should the research laboratory feed evidence into the live trading system without creating look-ahead or uncontrolled adaptation?
- What are the hard portfolio, loss, margin, liquidity, and execution-risk limits?
- What should trigger hold, recenter, hedge, scale, or square-off actions?
- What broker/execution infrastructure should the bot eventually control?
